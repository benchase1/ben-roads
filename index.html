<h1>Ben's Road Website</h1>

<p>Welcome to Ben's road website (this is a working title). Launched on 1 January 2021, this website has my road pictures, dating back to June 2019, as well as other inforation about the roads.
This site's main focus is the roads of New England, as well as New York, New Jersey, and Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Not all pages have photos, because this site is more than just photos. Exit / junction lists as well as signage diagrams (made by me) can also be found on this site.</p>
